Hello, my name es Mauricio Tabares a.k.a matabares, mostly, my time is dedicated to computers and related stuff. Like a lot of developers around the world, my knowledge of computers comes from solving real-life problems instead of the academy. I'm an English language fan/student, and the idea behind this blog is to force myself to practice how to write in English. So feel free to put in contact with me if you find any error.

I need to improve my English because it is an essential tool to be more competitive and productive.

I want to produce a significant impact on my local society but mostly on myself and my family. I want to make software to help others' lives.

My favorites computer languages are Python and C.
